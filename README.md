# BOSM'17 - Intro Website
## PLEASE FIX THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED TO YOU BY TONIGHT (27/4/17)

## Development Notes
- Each contributor should make a separate branch.
- make a folder with the name of your branch in the home of the repository on your branch
- This is to prevent any merge conflicts in the future.
- Also, Do not use standard names like index.html, style.css, etc. Make the names more specific, like timer.css, timer.html.
- We will merge the branches later.
- Do not push changes to the master branch.
